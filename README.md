## Description

The Quick-Readme is a command-line tool designed to simplify the process of creating a professional README file for your projects. Built using Node.js, this application prompts you through a series of questions to gather essential information about your project and automatically generates a well-structured README.md file based on your inputs.

This tool is ideal for developers who want to quickly produce comprehensive documentation for their repositories without manually crafting each section of the README.
